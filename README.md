## Getting Started

This program was made to reformat icons from a 32 x 64 formatting into a 64 x 128.
It also got rid of the green backgrounds which is what the excluded color values part is for. Unfortunately, there were a couple of icons that I had to fix due to this, but overall much better than converting over a hundred of them by hand in photoshop.

The 722.png is the example input and the ROWLET.png is the example output.
